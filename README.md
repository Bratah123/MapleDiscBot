# MapleDiscBot
"Universal" plug n play maplestory discord bot for your private server.

I tried to make this maplestory discord bot as plug n play as possible but you are still going to need to some work.
Note, I'm don't claim to be a good programmer and there might be some memes in here but it could help newer people
and I think its time I released something :P

Make sure to use Visual Studio Code for any debugging or editing.
